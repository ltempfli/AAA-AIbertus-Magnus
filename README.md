This GitHub repositiory is structured as follows:

The data folder contains all datasets (except the datasets that are too big to upload on Github) and scripts for retrieving the data.

The tasks folder contains all notebooks that are used to work on the tasks and contains all the visualizations presented in the report.

In order to execute the File the following order should be adhered
1. Execute Download_trip_data_API.ipynb to get the trip data
2. Execute Web_scraping_weather_data.ipynb to get the wheater data
3. Execute PoI_Data.ipynb to get POI data
4. Excecute Sports_data.ipynb to get the sports data
5. After that, 01_Data_Preparation.ipynb has to executed to get the data for the next tasks
6. Each other Notebook can be executed separately

We created environment_yml for each task separately 

All notebooks have been developed on windows so executing them on another operating sytem might cause unexpected behavior
